# Project Overview:

Imagine a scenario where a city traffic department aims to employ swarm UAVs (drones) to gather traffic data from various points throughout the city. The derived vehicle trajectory data will be used to improve traffic flow and other initiatives. The project requires building a scalable data warehouse to hold this trajectory data.
The Extract Load Transform (ELT) framework with dbt will be used. Unlike traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), ELT allows analytic engineers to set up transformation workflows as needed.

# data warehouse tech stack using PostgreSQL, dbt, Airflow, and Redash
